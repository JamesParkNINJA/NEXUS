<h2><?php echo $projectID; ?> needs your attention!</h2>
<p>
    Hi there <?php echo $cfname; ?>,
</p>
<p>
    Just reminding you that <?php echo $designer; ?> has completed request <?php echo $projectID; ?> and needs you to sign it off.
</p>
<p>
    You can view the job and sign it off from this link: <a href="<?php echo $permalink; ?>"><?php echo $pname; ?></a>
</p>
<p>
    Best regards,<br>
